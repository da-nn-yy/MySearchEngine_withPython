Query processing in Information Retrieval (IR) involves transforming user search queries into a format suitable for matching against indexed documents. This process includes tokenization, which breaks the query into individual terms; normalization, which standardizes terms (e.g., converting to lowercase); and stop-word removal, which filters out common, non-informative words. Stemming and lemmatization reduce words to their root forms, ensuring that variations of a word are recognized as the same term. These operations help refine the query, making the retrieval process more efficient and improving the accuracy and relevance of search results.
