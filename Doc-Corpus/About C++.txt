C++ is a powerful, high-performance programming language that was developed as an extension of the C programming language. Created by Bjarne Stroustrup in 1985, C++ incorporates both high-level and low-level language features, enabling developers to write complex systems and applications with fine control over system resources. It supports various programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming, making it versatile for a wide range of applications from operating systems and game development to real-time simulations and embedded systems. C++ introduces the concept of classes and objects, allowing for code reuse through inheritance and polymorphism, which enhances modularity and maintainability. Its Standard Template Library (STL) provides a rich set of template classes and functions for data structures and algorithms, promoting efficient and robust code. Despite its complexity and steep learning curve, C++ remains a popular choice for performance-critical applications due to its efficiency, extensive libraries, and ability to interface directly with hardware.
