Carbohydrate-rich foods are essential components of a balanced diet, providing the primary source of energy for the body. These foods can be categorized into simple and complex carbohydrates. Simple carbohydrates, found in foods like fruits, honey, and dairy products, provide quick energy through sugars. Complex carbohydrates, which include whole grains, legumes, vegetables, and starchy foods like potatoes and rice, offer sustained energy and are rich in fiber, vitamins, and minerals. Whole grains, such as brown rice, quinoa, and oats, are particularly beneficial because they contain the entire grain kernel, providing more nutrients and fiber than refined grains. Including a variety of carbohydrate-rich foods in the diet supports energy levels, digestion, and overall health.
