Protein-rich foods are essential for building and repairing tissues, supporting immune function, and maintaining muscle mass. Examples include lean meats like chicken and turkey, fish such as salmon and tuna, eggs, dairy products like Greek yogurt and cottage cheese, legumes such as beans and lentils, nuts and seeds, and tofu. These foods provide essential amino acids that the body cannot produce on its own, making them crucial for overall health and well-being. Incorporating a variety of protein sources into your diet ensures you get a balanced intake of nutrients necessary for optimal body function.
