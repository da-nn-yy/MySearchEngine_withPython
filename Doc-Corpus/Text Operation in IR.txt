In Information Retrieval (IR), text operations are fundamental to the process of indexing, searching, and retrieving relevant documents from a large corpus. Key text operations include tokenization, which involves breaking text into individual words or phrases; stemming and lemmatization, which reduce words to their root forms; and stop-word removal, which eliminates common words that carry little meaning. Additionally, text operations encompass the calculation of term frequency and inverse document frequency (TF-IDF) to determine the importance of terms within documents. These operations enable efficient searching and ranking of documents, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of search results in IR systems.
