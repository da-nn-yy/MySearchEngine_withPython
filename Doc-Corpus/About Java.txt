Java is a widely-used, high-level programming language known for its portability, security, and robustness. Developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle), Java was released in 1995 and has since become a cornerstone of enterprise and web application development. Java applications run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), allowing them to be platform-independent ("write once, run anywhere"). It supports object-oriented programming principles and includes a vast standard library and ecosystem of frameworks and tools. Java is favored for its scalability, performance, and suitability for large-scale projects, making it a popular choice for backend development, Android app development, and enterprise solutions.
