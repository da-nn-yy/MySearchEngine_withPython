Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability, making it a popular choice for both beginners and experienced developers. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming. Python has a vast standard library and a vibrant ecosystem of third-party packages, which makes it versatile for various applications, such as web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and automation. Its cross-platform nature and robust community support further contribute to its widespread adoption and continuous growth.
