Information retrieval (IR) is the process of obtaining relevant information from a large repository, such as a database or the internet, based on a user's query. It involves techniques for indexing, searching, and ranking documents to match the user's informational needs. IR systems use algorithms to analyze and understand both the query and the content of documents, employing methods like keyword matching, semantic analysis, and machine learning. The goal is to provide users with the most relevant and useful information quickly and efficiently, which is crucial in applications ranging from search engines and digital libraries to recommendation systems and data mining.
